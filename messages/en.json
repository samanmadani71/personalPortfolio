    "description": "The websites I have created so far showcase my skills using modern web development technologies. For the frontend, I use React and Next.js, styled with shadcn/ui for components and Tailwind CSS for custom designs. On the backend, I leverage Django and Django REST Framework to develop robust APIs that seamlessly deliver data to the frontend. To ensure reliability and correctness, I write comprehensive tests using Django REST Framework's TestCase. This combination of technologies demonstrates my ability to build scalable, well-tested, and visually appealing full-stack applications."
